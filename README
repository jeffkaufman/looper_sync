This is code to allow one to use a linux computer as a looping pedal.
It's designed around a three button mouse that I made foot operated.
It works better when run on a virtual terminal because then your
clicks don't go to X.

Usage:

  $ sudo apt-get install jackd libjack-dev
  $ make
  plug in usb mouse
  $ sudo chmod ugo+r /dev/input/mouse*
  plug in external microphone, speakers
  mess with alsamixer and make them reasonable for recording and playback
  $ jackd -d alsa -p 256 &
  $ ./looper_sync

Operation:

 - tap a pedal to start a loop, tap it again to start looping, tap it
   a third time to stop it.

 - once you have a primary loop going, tapping another pedal will make
   it wait until the top of the loop, then start recording for one
   time through.  This loop will immediately start playing when it's
   done recording.  Once playing, additional taps will quiet it.


Warning: 

  if you use a mouse that reports X and Y (not a stripped three button
  mouse turned into a stompbox) then because I'm lazy and don't parse
  /dev/input/mouse properly you'll confuse it.


Copying: 

  the base code was jack sample code, which I think is under the gpl.
  My changes to it are as free as is allowed.  That is, if the example
  code is actually public domain, so is this.  Otherwise, it's gpl.

Usage:

  $ sudo apt-get install jackd libjack-dev
  $ make
  plug in usb mouse
  $ sudo chmod ugo+r /dev/input/mouse*
  plug in external microphone, speakers
  mess with alsamixer and make them reasonable for recording and playback
  $ jackd -d alsa -p 256 &
  $ ./looper_sync

Warning: if you use a mouse that reports X and Y (not a stripped three
button mouse turned into a stompbox) then because I'm lazy and don't
parse /dev/input/mouse properly you'll confuse it.
